# About Circuit Parts

If you are reading this, then you're probably interested in finding out why we built Circuit Parts. Well, you've come to the right place.

If you are a Hardware Design Engineer, then you likely have fifteen tabs open in your browser: one for inventory management, one for a component search engine, one for a design calculator, at least three to four component distributor websites, a couple more websites for PCB fabrication and assembly, and on, and on‚Ä¶ oh, let‚Äôs not forget, each website has its own interface and login.

While the problem might sound familiar to a Hardware Design Engineer, the underlying problem is actually quite common. Imagine you're planning a camping trip and you need to buy various supplies: tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, and first-aid kits etc. What do you think is easier and much more efficient?

1. Running around numerous stores in your town to buy all your supplies or
2. Just walking into a single store like Walmart that carries everything you need?

That‚Äôs where [Circuit Parts](https://circuitparts.in) comes in. We want to streamline the way you order components, PCBs and PCBAs. As a first step, we are consolidating much of your workflow into a single,**all-in-one shopping platform for embedded electronics.**

**But wait, there's more!** We want to create a comprehensive platform for all your electronic manufacturing needs. We have a ton of stuff on our roadmap that will be available for our users in the coming months:

1. **Project Management Tool:** Create a new project and add your Bill of Materials (BOM) to the project making it easier to organise shopping list as per projects and order the parts with just a few clicks.
2. **AI based part recommendation:** Our AI based recommendation system will suggest the best parts for your project based on your requirements. For example, you can ask ‚ÄúCreate a list of components needed to build a 555 timer circuit‚Äù and our AI jumps into action and suggests you all the parts needed to build a 555 timer circuit. Not just that, it even adds them to your cart. How cool is that?
3. **Download ECAD symbols, Footprints and 3D models:** Search for a part on the platform, and you'll find associated ECAD symbols, footprints, and 3D models readily available for download in compatible formats.
4. **Electronic Design Calculators:** No more manual calculations. Use our calculators to get the right values based on the current IPC standards.
5. **Extensions for ECAD tools:** Integrate our extensions with your existing ECAD software for seamless ordering of components and PCBs directly from within your CAD tools.
6. **Inventory management:** Organise inventory with our inventory management tool that seamlessly integrates with our ordering platform letting users order parts with just couple of clicks.

And there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶üòâ

We hope you‚Äôve gained a good sense of why we started Circuit Parts. Challenging the status quo is no easy task, but we invite you to check out the platform, order some products, and help us improve it further.
