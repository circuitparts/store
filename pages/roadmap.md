# Roadmap

Our roadmap typically looks out 12 months and we establish topics we want to work on. We don't start with our roadmap on a blank sheet. We develop it based on our last roadmap, the findings we made over the course of the last year, and of course from what we hear from you in issues and discussions.

When we execute on our roadmap, we keep learning and our assessment of some of the topics listed changes. As a result, we may add or drop topics as we go. After around 12 months we come together to develop the next roadmap.

We describe some initiatives as "investigations" or "explorations" which means our goal in the next few months is to better understand the problem and potential solutions before scheduling actual feature work. Once an investigation is done, we will update our plans, either deferring the initiative or committing to it.

As always we have a ton of stuff on our roadmap that will be available for our users in the coming months.

1. **Project Management Tool:** Create a new project and add your Bill of Materials (BOM) to the project making it easier to organise shopping list as per projects and order the parts with just a few clicks.
2. **AI based part recommendation:** Our AI based recommendation system will suggest the best parts for your project based on your requirements. For example, you can ask “Create a list of components needed to build a 555 timer circuit” and our AI jumps into action and suggests you all the parts needed to build a 555 timer circuit. Not just that, it even adds them to your cart. How cool is that?
3. **Download ECAD symbols, Footprints and 3D models:** Search for a part on the platform, and you'll find associated ECAD symbols, footprints, and 3D models readily available for download in compatible formats.
4. **Electronic Design Calculators:** No more manual calculations. Use our calculators to get the right values based on the current IPC standards.
5. **Extensions for ECAD tools:** Integrate our extensions with your existing ECAD software for seamless ordering of components and PCBs directly from within your CAD tools.
6. **Inventory management:** Organise inventory with our inventory management tool that seamlessly integrates with our ordering platform letting users order parts with just couple of clicks.

**Conclusion**:

These are examples of some of the work we will be focusing on in the next 12 months. We continuously tune the plan based on feedback and we update the documentation. We will develop our next roadmap in around 12 months from now. Please follow along and let us know what you think!
