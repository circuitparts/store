## How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step in order to learn more about the project. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`).

To get started, checkout the [Installation guide](installation.md).

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although the docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, it's a good idea to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on the app functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. However, If you need to brush up on your React skills, check out this [React Foundations Course](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations) by the nextjs team, which will introduce you to the fundamentals. If you wish to learn more about Next.js then checkout this [Learn Nextjs Cource](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) again by the nextjs team.
