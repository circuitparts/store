# Change Currency

Circuit Parts supports multiple currencies. When you visit the website, we automatically detect your location from your IP address and set the currency as per your location. If your local currency is not supported by us, we set the currency to US Dollars (USD) by default.  

Optionally, you can always change from the default currency to the currency of your choice from the dropdown menu on the top right corner of the page.

At the moment we support the following currencies:
1. US Dollars (USD)
2. Indian Rupees (INR)
3. British Pounds (GBP)
4. Euros (EUR)
5. Australian Dollars (AUD)

We will be adding support for more currencies in the future.
