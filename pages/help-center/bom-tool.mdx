# Use Bill of Materials (BOM) Tool to Order Components

The Bill of Materials (BOM) tool is a feature that allows you to order components by uploading a BOM file. The BOM tool will automatically searches the components in your BOM file and adds them to your cart. This will save you time and effort in searching for components and adding them to your cart manually.

This feature is available for all users, including those who are not logged in.

### BOM Tool

In the homepage, click the "Upload your BOM" button. This will take you to the BOM tool page.

### Download our BOM Template

The tool works best with our BOM template. Click the "Download Circuit Parts BOM Template" link to download the template. The template is a CSV file that you can open in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

### Fill in the BOM Template

Open the BOM template and fill in the required fields. The required fields are the Manufacturer Part Number, Description, and Quantity. You can omit the other fields as they are optional.

### Review Cart

After uploading the BOM file, the tool will automatically search for the components in your BOM file and add them to your cart. Review the cart to make sure that all the components are added correctly. If any components are not available, you can manually search for them and add them to your cart.
