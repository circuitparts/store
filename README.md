## About Circuit Parts

[Circuit Parts](https://www.circuitparts.in) was founded in 2022 to eliminate a major bottleneck in Hardware development: sourcing electronic and semiconductor parts for your project. The traditional process of finding, vetting, and managing suppliers, getting quotes, and tracking orders across many component distributors and PCB design houses is incredibly resource-intensive and prone to miscommunication, delays, and mistakes. These barriers make hardware development a slow, painful, high-risk endeavor.

We engineered a new approach ‚Äî A digital quote-to-order platform. It provides a convenient place for individuals and businesses to purchase electronic and semiconductor components, upload designs and receive instant quotes for PCB fabrication and assembly, all in one place, eliminating the need to navigate multiple websites.
