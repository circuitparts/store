## About Circuit Parts

### The problem

Buying electronic & semiconductor components, getting Printed Circuit Boards(PCBs) manufactured and assembled can be a big challenge for product manufacturing companies or as a matter of fact to anyone in that industry. This is because they have to deal with many different suppliers and manufacturers, which can be slow and inefficient. Miscommunication, back-and-forth emails, delays, and errors are common, and these issues can delay product launches.

### The Solution

Say hello to Circuit Parts! It offers a convenient place for individuals and businesses to browse and select from a wide range of electronic parts, submit PCB designs for fabrication and assembly services. You can find more detailed information about our business on our <a href="https://www.circuitparts.in"><strong>website</strong></a>.

## The Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run circuit parts on your machine:

-   [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
-   macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
-   npm _(recommended)_

## Development üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

### Setup

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the fork button located at the top right of this page and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

2. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/circuitparts/store.git
    ```

3. Go to the project folder

    ```sh
    cd store
    ```

4. Install packages with yarn

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

5. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`

    ```sh
     cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

6. Replace all the placeholders in the `.env` file with their respective keys. You can register for an account on their website and get a key to use it in your project.

7. Setup the database by following the instructions defined in [Setting up Database](#setting-up-database)

8. Run the development server. By default the app starts on port `3000`. If the port is busy it throws an error.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

9. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

Circuit Parts is built on top of the default directory structure created by ` create-next-app`.

### Top-level folders

Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

| Folder       | Description                                                                                           |
